					<div class="container"><a id="titletext"><li>Reason 1: very comlicatedd css structure</li></a>
						<div class="info">Due to the many options and configurations of bootstrap the css structure is long an d difficult to undersatnd. 
								To get an element on the desired place you have add a lot of lines to the classname of the element.</div>
							<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="container"><a id="titletext"><li>Reason 2: increased loadingtime of websites</li></a>
							<div class="info">Because of the many lines of code in the css of bootstrap, your browser has a lot to load. 
								It's because of this reason that the loading time in comparison to other websites is longer.</div>
							<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="container"><a id="titletext"><li>Reason 3: reverse engineering</li></a>
						<div class="info">When working with bootstrap, I always have a moment where I have a div element
							and want to move this element. But bootstrap hates it when I try to move things, I dont have the energy to 
							figure out how to move the object in bootstrap code itself. If I am going to do it that way I'll end up with a long code and a short temper.
							Thats why I mostly will break the bootstrap css code and overide it with my own, with the result being horrible. 
							After an hour or two I just get the urge to pick my laptop and throw it out of a window. So bootstrap fast 
							and easy, nope it isn't. You wil lose more time to correct bootstrap's mistakes then you would creating 
							your own css.
						</div>
						<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="container"><a id="titletext"><li>Reason 4: taking a hold of your creativity</li></a>
							<div class="info">Due to the "awesome" bootstrap css stucture, you're website will end up as a bootstrap creation.
										Almost every website using bootstrap looks the same. it's because of the bootstrap template that you end up using bootstrap's 
										creativity, instead of your own. ofcourse you can chance the bootstrap css, but what use will it have. Taking a template changing the css,
										and still ending up with your own css. To give you're own twist to bootstrap you will have to change at least 80% of the code you're using,
										not to mention that the part you're using is 20% of all of bootstap's code.

						<div class="container"><a id="titletext"><li>Reason 5: the stubbornness of bootstrap</li></a>
							<div class="info">
								My experience with bootstrap:
								<br>
									Design team: "Is it okay if I put this here?"<br>
									<br>
									Me: "No, it's not okay if you put that there."<br>
									<br>
									Design team: "Are you sure? It'd be really cool if I could put that there."<br>
									<br>
									Me: "No, I will need to fuck with a lot of things if you put that there, just put it in the bootstrap columns."<br>
									<br>
									Design team: "Hold on, lemme see if it's okay to put that there."<br>
									<br>
									Lead-dev: "He's right, you shouldn't put that there."<br>
									<br>
									Company: "We should have a meeting to discuss where the design team can and can't put things."<br>
									<br>
									Lead-dev: "Just put the things in the middle and devide them in these twelve columns on seperate rows, 'kay?"<br>
									<br>
									Company: "Okay, the design team will now put the thing in those things, right design team?"<br>
									<br>
									Design team: "Yes, we agree to putting the thing where we should put the thing."<br>
									<br>
									Me: "So where do you want the thing now?"<br>
									<br>
									Design team: "I want it all the way to the right, outside of the container, that'd look cool."<br>
									<br>
									Me: "F*ck you."
