				I started with the havo in English equal to middle school. I have a diploma for this and finished with classes like chemistry, physics, mathematics algebra, biology and economics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I started with forensic research in Enschede at Hoge school Saxion. There I got classes like different sorts of traces, legislation, skills I had to acquire during the schooling.<br> I didn’t finish this because I didn’t fancy the lessons anymore and I could not see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I also had not enough points to get to the next year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my gap year I did something similar to my last education. Then I still wanted to do something for the police and I really wanted to find a way and this seemed interesting to learn for me. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a diploma for this. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After this I got a clearer image of what I wanted and I then would like to do something with computers or robots. So I moved to Hogeschool Utrecht. Here I did HBO ICT and wanted to do finish with computer engineering. The first half year was a combination with other fields of study. Like the programming side and the business side. I really enjoyed doing this study. It was difficult at some moments. Like the education before I did not get my diploma, but I learned that I wanted to do more with IT. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore I ended with MBO ICT a level below HBO. I am still doing this study at Alfa-college in Groningen. This time I really want to get my diploma and maybe improve my programming skills. Now I get courses like JavaScript, PHP (soon), Cisco, Windows server, SQL, Web design, Linux and a lot of more in the future.
